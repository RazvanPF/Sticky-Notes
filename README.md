# Sticky Notes App

## Overview
The Sticky Notes App allows users to create and manage digital sticky notes on a virtual board. This application is designed to mimic the behavior of physical sticky notes, making it intuitive for organizing tasks, notes, and reminders. Users can add, move, and delete notes, as well as customize text and include hyperlinks.

### Features
- **Create Sticky Notes:** Click on a blank area of the board to add notes.
- **Drag and Drop:** Rearrange notes on the board by dragging them to different positions.
- **Edit Content:** Edit the text within sticky notes. Formatting options include fonts, colors, and hyperlinks.
- **Persistence:** Notes are saved locally in your browser, allowing you to close the tab and return without losing your data.
- **Share Functionality:** [BETA] Generate a shareable URL to collaborate with others (Note: Large content may result in URLs that exceed typical length limits for browsers).
- **Date & Tag settings:** You can assign a date range (from - to) as well as a "tag" for each individual sticky note
- **Filter:** : Filtering by date range and tag is possible using the filter toolbar.
